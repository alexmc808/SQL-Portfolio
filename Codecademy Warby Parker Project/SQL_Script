-- QUIZ FUNNEL --

-- #1. View first 10 rows of Style Quiz survey, which is in a table called 'survey'.

SELECT *
FROM survey
LIMIT 10;
-- Columns in table: question, user_id, response

-- #2. Analyze how many users move from Q1 to Q2, etc.

SELECT question,
  COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS 'num_users'
FROM survey
GROUP BY 1;
-- Q1: 500 responses, Q2: 475 responses, Q3: 380 responses, Q4: 361 responses, Q5: 270 responses

-- #3. Calculate percentage of users who answered each question. Which question(s) have lower completion rates? What do you think the reason is?

-- Q1: 100% of users, Q2: 95% of users, Q3: 80% of users, Q4: 95% of users, Q5: 75% of users. Questions 3 and 5 have the lowest completion rates. Question 3 is "which shapes do you like?" and question 5 is "when was your last eye exam?" I think question 3 has a lower completion rate because it is hard to decide what shapes you like just from looking at them but not being able to try them on yourself. Question 5 may have a lower completion rate because it involves giving out medical information, which users may not feel comfortable sharing. 

-- HOME TRY-ON FUNNEL --

-- #4. Examine first 5 rows of each table in funnel: quiz, home_try_on, and purchase.

SELECT *
FROM quiz
LIMIT 5;
-- Columns in table: user_id, style, fit, shape, color

SELECT *
FROM home_try_on
LIMIT 5;
-- Columns in table: user_id, number_of_pairs, address

SELECT *
FROM purchase
LIMIT 5;
-- Columns in table: user_id, product_id, style, model_name, color, price

-- #5. Use a left join to combine the three tables. Select only the first 10 rows from the resulting table.

SELECT DISTINCT quiz.user_id,
  home_try_on.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_home_try_on',
  home_try_on.number_of_pairs,
  purchase.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_purchase'
FROM quiz
LEFT JOIN home_try_on
  ON quiz.user_id = home_try_on.user_id
LEFT JOIN purchase
  ON home_try_on.user_id = purchase.user_id
LIMIT 10;

-- #6. Analyze funnel to make actionable insights for Warby Parker.

--Calculte overall conversion rates by aggregating across all rows. Compare conversion from quiz --> home_try_on and home_try_on --> purchase.

WITH funnel AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT quiz.user_id,

  1.0 * SUM(is_purchase) / SUM(is_home_try_on) AS 'home_try_on_to_purchase'
FROM funnel;
-- 1000 users completed the quiz, 750 users did the home try on, and 495 users made a purchase. Therefore, 75% of the users that completed the quiz did a home try on and 66% of the users who did the home try on purchased glasses.

-- Calculate difference in purchase rates between customers who had 3 number_of_pairs and 5 number_of_pairs.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT 
    CASE
      WHEN number_of_pairs = '3 pairs' THEN user_id
    END) AS 'num_3_pairs',
  COUNT(DISTINCT 
    CASE
      WHEN number_of_pairs = '5 pairs' THEN user_id
    END) AS 'num_5_pairs'
FROM home_try_on;
-- Out of 750 users who did the at home try on, 379 users got 3 pairs of glasses and 371 users got 5 pairs of glasses.

WITH funnel AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT quiz.user_id,
    home_try_on.user_id IS NOT NULL AS 'is_home_try_on',

  SUM(is_purchase) AS 'num_purchase',
  1.0 * SUM(is_purchase) / COUNT(number_of_pairs) AS 'perc_purchase'
FROM funnel
WHERE number_of_pairs IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1;
-- 53% of users who received 3 pairs to try on at home purchased glasses whereas  79% of users who received 5 pairs to try on at home purchased glasses. This infers that receiving more glasses to try on at home is better.
